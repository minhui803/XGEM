Folder **"PseDSSPC"**: the parameter adjustment process of PseDSSPC

d1.ipynb  represents the adjustment process when d=1.

Run the "**d1.ipynb**",we can get the TN, FN, TP, accuracy, recall,precision,F1_score,AUC of different combinations.

Then, we organize the accuracy under each parameter combination into another table and name it "**1.csv**", 

d2.ipynb represents the adjustment process when d=2.

 Run the **"d2.ipynb**", we can get TN, FN, TP, accuracy,recall, precision, F1_score, AUC of different combinations.

Then, we organize the accuracy under each parameter combination into another table and name it "**2.csv**"

**d3.ipynb r**epresents the adjustment process when d=3.

Run the "**d3.ipynb**", we can get TN, FN, TP, accuracy,recall, precision, F1_score, AUC of different combinations.

Then, we organize the accuracy under each parameter combination into another table and name it "**3.csv**"

**d4.ipynb** represents the adjustment process when d=4

Run the "**d4.ipynb**", we can get TN, FN, TP, accuracy,recall, precision, F1_score, AUC of different combinations.

Then, we organize the accuracy under each parameter combination into another table and name it "**4.csv**"

**d5.ipynb** represents the adjustment process when d=5

Run the "**d5.ipynb**", we can get TN, FN, TP, accuracy,recall, precision, F1_score, AUC of different combinations.

Then, we organize the accuracy under each parameter combination into another table and name it "**5.csv**"

**d6.ipynb** represents the adjustment process when d=6

Run the "**d6.ipynb**", we can get TN, FN, TP, accuracy,recall, precision, F1_score, AUC of different combinations.

Then, we organize the accuracy under each parameter combination into another table and name it "**6.csv**"

**d7.ipynb** represents the adjustment process when d=7

Run the "**d7.ipynb**", we can get TN, FN, TP, accuracy,recall, precision, F1_score, AUC of different combinations.

Then, we organize the accuracy under each parameter combination into another table and name it "**7.csv**"

d8.ipynb represents the adjustment process when d=8

Run the "**d8.ipynb**", we can get TN, FN, TP, accuracy,recall, precision, F1_score, AUC of different combinations.

Then, we organize the accuracy under each parameter combination into another table and name it "**8.csv**"

**d9.ipynb** represents the adjustment process when d=9

Run the "**d9.ipynb**", we can get TN, FN, TP, accuracy,recall, precision, F1_score, AUC of different combinations.

Then, we organize the accuracy under each parameter combination into another table and name it "**9.csv**"

**d10.ipynb** represents the adjustment process when d=10

Run the "**d10.ipynb**", we can get TN, FN, TP, accuracy,recall, precision, F1_score, AUC of different combinations.

Then, we organize the accuracy under each parameter combination into another table and name it "**10.csv**"

**Finally, we can get 10 csv files. Put the 10 csv files in the  XEGM/figures/drawing directory, the run PseDSSPC.ipynb ,we can get a thermal map , it reflects the accuracy value of PseDSSPC under different parameter combinations.**
